## React Native Trolley Tracker By Code For Miami

Android and iOS React Native phone apps to display City of Miami trolley system. Currently broken at the moment due to City of Miami changing trolley provider in 2017. The code here is still useful and is a basis for how to develop React Native apps with remote cloud content push.

## Leaflet Transit

Web app using Leaflet Javascript mapping library to show all transportation services in Miami-Dade County on a map.  
City of Miami trolley system no longer appears due to a new provider.  
Note that this is a heavy app that will make many requests so wait for the data to load.  
Click Refresh to see data change live.  
This is a good project to learn how to access various data sources in Miami-Dade County.  
Inspect the code in Chrome debugger and see the index.js file and the requests made.
