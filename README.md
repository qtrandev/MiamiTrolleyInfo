## React Native Trolley Tracker By Code For Miami

Android and iOS React Native phone apps to display City of Miami trolley system. Currently broken at the moment due to City of Miami changing trolley provider in 2017. The code here is still useful and is a basis for how to develop React Native apps with remote cloud content push.

## Leaflet Transit

Web app using Leaflet Javascript mapping library to show all transportation services in Miami-Dade County on a map.  
City of Miami trolley system no longer appears due to a new provider.  
Note that this is a heavy app that will make many requests so wait for the data to load.  
Click Refresh to see data change live.  
This is a good project to learn how to access various data sources in Miami-Dade County.  
Inspect the code in Chrome debugger and see the index.js file and the requests made.

## Bus Tracking GPS (Inactive)

Shows how to build a GPS Tracker using an Arduino board for tracking trolley buses.  Information here is still useful to build a tracker though, but getting a data plan is not maintainable.  
This project is now inactive since Quyen went on a personal hiatus and data plan costs $30 a month to maintain.  
Code For Miami partnered with City of Sweetwater for a pilot but this became inactive. Hardware is still at Sweetwater Transportation Department, which needs to be retrieved since this project ended.
